Hack the Hill Hackathon


I wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude for the opportunity to participate in Hack the Hill alongside Ryan. It was an incredible experience that I will always cherish.

During the hackathon, Ryan and I learned so much about coding, problem-solving, and teamwork. We were able to push our skills to the limit and come up with some really innovative ideas. I am so proud of the work we accomplished together.

In particular, I am thrilled about the projects we developed. Our TCP server and client that can stream live video is something that I never would have thought possible before, but we were able to achieve it through our collaboration and determination. Our TCP protocol full custom encrypted chat room was another highlight of the hackathon. It was a great feeling to come up with our own encrypted algorithm, and to see it in action was truly amazing.

Thank you again for giving us the opportunity to participate in Hack the Hill. We learned so much and are so grateful for the experience. I look forward to seeing what the future holds for both of us.

Best regards,
Umer Qamar
